“Model and Analyse Server Load Distributions Using Integrals to Enhance Load Balancing Strategies in Network Engineering”
🔷 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to simulate and analyze how server load fluctuates over time and how we can apply mathematical techniques (like integrals) to measure imbalance and improve load balancing across multiple servers in a network.

🔷 Key Concepts Used
Server Load: The number of requests per second a server handles.

Load Fluctuation: Modeled using sine functions and random variations to reflect real-world usage.

Integral Calculus: Used to calculate the total imbalance across time — higher values mean worse load distribution.

Dynamic Redistribution: A simple algorithm identifies overloaded/underloaded servers and simulates shifting traffic.

🔷 Workflow Overview
Input Phase:

User specifies details for each server: name, capacity, base load, fluctuation amplitude, latency.

These values define the server's characteristics over a 24-hour period.

Simulation Phase:

Each server’s load is modeled as:

Load
(
𝑡
)
=
Base
+
𝐴
⋅
sin
⁡
(
𝜋
𝑡
12
+
𝜙
)
+
noise
+
bursts
Load(t)=Base+A⋅sin( 
12
πt
​
 +ϕ)+noise+bursts
Noise and bursts are added to simulate real-world unpredictability.

Analysis Phase:

Compute average load across all servers at each time step.

Calculate the imbalance using:

Imbalance
(
𝑡
)
=
∑
(
Load
𝑖
(
𝑡
)
−
Average
(
𝑡
)
)
2
Imbalance(t)=∑(Load 
i
​
 (t)−Average(t)) 
2
 
Integrate this imbalance over time using Simpson's rule to get a total imbalance score.

Load Balancing Phase:

If imbalance exceeds a threshold, redistribute load from overloaded to underloaded servers.

Recalculate the imbalance after redistribution to measure improvement.

Visualization:

4 plots are shown:

Original server loads over time.

Imbalance metric across time.

Loads after redistribution.

Bar graph comparing total imbalance (before vs after).

Insights:

Total imbalance reduction percentage.

Times of peak load.

Warnings if any server nears overload.
